# Example Repository
This is a sample repo, hello world!

#.md = markdown file

# stage = the process of preparing the code before committing to github. Eg: putting the file in a box
# the command to stage a file is "git add (file name)"
# the command "git status" let's you know the status of files
# commit = the process of 'wrapping' the box. It is still not shipped YET
# the command to commit is "git commit -m "FILE NAME""
# -m = message
# now we need to push the file
# "git push origin master"
# the code above stands for: "git, execute command -> push this code to somewhere -> "origin" is which branch -> "master" is the front page of the repo, eg: default file.
